# Using SplinterDB

SplinterDB is an embedded key-value store.  It is currently Linux-only.

To use SplinterDB, you must link your program to the library and call
the C functions declared in the [`include/splinterdb`](../include/splinterdb)
headers.  More details on our build process are [here](build.md).

This document is a high-level overview, but the code comments in the
[header files](../include/splinterdb) are the definitive API reference.
We're actively evolving our public API surface right now, and will do our
best to keep this document up to date as details change.  If something
looks out-of-date, please open an issue or pull request.

## Program flow

- Choose values for [configuration options](../include/splinterdb/splinterdb.h#:~:text=Configuration%20options%20for%20SplinterDB)
  defined in the `splinterdb_config{}` structure.
  For the `data_cfg` field, simple applications may opt to use
  the `default_data_config_init()`
  [initializer method](../src/default_data_config.c#:~:text=default%5Fdata%5Fconfig%5Finit)
  which provides a basic key / value interface with lexicographical
  sorting of keys.

- Call `splinterdb_create()` to create a new database in a file or block device,
  `splinterdb_open()` to open an existing database, and
  `splinterdb_close()` to flush any pending writes and close the database.

   All access to a SplinterDB database file or device must go through the
   single `splinterdb*` object returned.  It is not safe for more than one
   process to open the same SplinterDB database file or device.

- Basic key/value operations like `insert`, `delete`, point `lookup` and
  range scan using an `iterator` are available.  See the code comments
  in [`splinterdb.h`](../include/splinterdb/splinterdb.h).

- If an application frequently makes small modifications to existing values,
  better performance may be possible by using a custom `data_config` object
  and the `splinterdb_insert_raw_message()` function.
  A raw message may encode a "blind update" to a value, for example an
  "append" or "increment" operation that may be persisted without doing a read.
  Some applications may be able to avoid a read-modify-write sequence this way.
  To use the message-oriented API, the application implements the `data_config`
  interface defined in
  [`data.h`](../include/splinterdb/data.h#:~:text=struct%20data%5Fconfig%20{))
  and sets it on `splinterdb_config` when creating/opening a database.

- SplinterDB is designed to deliver high-performance for multi-threaded
  applications, but follow these guidelines:

  - The thread which called `splinterdb_create()` or `splinterdb_open()`
    is called the "initial thread".

  - The initial thread should be the one to call `splinterdb_close()` when
    the `splinterdb` instance is no longer needed.

  - Threads (other than the initial thread) that will use the `splinterdb`
    must be registered before use and unregistered before exiting:

    - From a non-initial thread, call `splinterdb_register_thread()`.
      Internally, SplinterDB will allocate scratch space for use by that thread.

    - To avoid leaking memory, a non-initial thread should call
      `splinterdb_deregister_thread()` before it exits.

  - Known issue: In a pinch, non-initial, registered threads may call
    `splinterdb_close()`, but their scratch memory would be leaked.

  - Note these rules apply to system threads, not [runtime-managed threading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads)
    available in higher-level languages.

- Internally SplinterDB supports asynchronous IO, but this capability is not
  yet documented.  Some example code for this may be found in the unit and
  functional tests.


## Example programs
- [`tests/unit/splinterdb_quick_test.c`](../tests/unit/splinterdb_quick_test.c) covers
   various basic operations on a single thread. The
   [setup step](../tests/unit/splinterdb_quick_test.c#:~:text=CTEST%5FSETUP\(splinterdb%5Fquick)
   shows how to specify a default configuration and then create a new instance.
- [`tests/unit/splinterdb_stress_test.c`](../tests/unit/splinterdb_stress_test.c) uses multiple threads
- [`tests/unit/splinter_test.c`](../tests/unit/splinter_test.c#:~:text=CTEST%5FSETUP\(splinter)
  covers slightly advanced steps to create a SplinterDB instance. It covers
  configuration of a SplinterDB instance, creating heap memory, allocating
  memory for various sub-system configurations, and initialization of
  individual sub-systems.
