# SplinterDB Unit Testing

We have adapted the [CTest framework](https://github.com/bvdberg/ctest),
which is a unit testing framework for software written in C/C++,

See this [README.md](https://github.com/bvdberg/ctest/blob/master/README.md)
file for a fuller description of the features of this CTest framework.

See [Unit testing](../../docs/unit-testing.md)
for more details on unit test development and unit testing.
