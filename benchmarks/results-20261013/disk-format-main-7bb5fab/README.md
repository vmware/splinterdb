# disk-format: main integration evidence

Source merge: `d21b87f5cfac709fb0fa74c3585fb38936c08852`; main: `7bb5fab305b9c6179e31f75998dabea833537a08`.

[Correctness checks](tests/README.md) include exact commands, hashes and retained initial failures. [Benchmark report](benchmarks/report.md), [project summary](benchmarks/summary.csv), and [verification status](benchmarks/status.json) describe the fresh real-disk screening.

Resident point throughput changed -1.21%/-1.92% at one/eight threads, and disk point throughput changed -0.81%. These sample ranges overlap main; substantial control drift prevents precise attribution of small differences.

The campaign ran 133 comparison processes, 12 fixture creators and one recorded warmup through 11 exclusive jobs. These compare each updated feature with main; they do not isolate merge cost. Main controls drifted; sample-range overlap is descriptive, not a statistical confidence interval. Query/hash/barrier runs validate data, while insert-only runs check API returns, positive counts and successful close without readback. All benchmark databases were on ext4 `/dev/mapper/snafu-root_crypt` with O_DIRECT and fsynced fixture copies.

`tests/archive-manifest.json` and `benchmarks/inventory.json` verify the small archived files. No database images, executables or core dumps are committed. Archived scripts retain original paths and must be adapted before replay outside the original campaign.
